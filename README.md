In this project, we try to reproduce the main findings based on paper _EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks._

The original paper's experiments were mainly conducted using the __ImageNet dataset__. In our project, we sought to reproduce the experiments using the __CIFAR-10__ and __CIFAR-100__ datasets. Please download the file __function.py__ and __model.py__ from main/models and import them while using efficientnet notebook.
